## About TogoDX/Human
TogoDX/Human is an application using the TogoDX* framework for integrated exploration, overview, and extraction of human-related data collected from domestic and international databases. Currently, data can be explored using more than 60 “attributes” (gene expression patterns, protein localization, classification by disease, etc.) derived from various databases of genes, proteins, compounds, and diseases etc.

#### *TogoDX (Togo Data eXplorer) is a framework for integrated exploration of various databases in the life sciences, integrated using a knowledge graph. TogoDX has been developed as a general-purpose framework and can be applied to various types of data other than human data.


## Features of TogoDX/Human
- Each attribute is represented as a hierarchical classification or a distribution of continuous values, allowing users to extract data by combining the attributes of interest while understanding the characteristics and relevance of the data according to their purposes and interests, which can be applied to narrowing down research targets.
- By entering their own ID list (e.g., a list of differentially expressed genes from the experiment), users can get a bird's-eye view of the distribution in each attribute, and unexpected connections and biases in other attributes can help in the interpretation and discussion of the experimental results.
- The table resulting from the filtering can easily check the information related to that ID. In addition, those integrated attribute information can be downloaded and used for further integrated analysis.

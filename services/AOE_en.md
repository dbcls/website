### Feature of AOE (All Of gene Expresssion)

* Direct data access from the histogram, and make the table with selecte entries.
* Updated data ranking by organisms and by methods enhances searchability of archived data.
* Dynamic histogram for selected organisms and methods can be produced only by click operation.

### Usage

* Examine the data ranking by organism.
* By clicking *Mus musculus*, only the data from mouse can be retrieved.
* In the data ranking by methods By selecting **Illumina**, data from Illumina sequencers can be retrieved.
* Quick access to orginal data from the table with selected entries.

### Next step

* In collaboration with [DNA Data Bank of Japan(DDBJ)](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/index-e.html)'s [DDBJ Omics Archive(DOR)](https://www.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/dor/index-e.html), we are going to add useful information from meta-analysis of archived data.

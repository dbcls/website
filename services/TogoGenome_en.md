# TogoGenome

TogoGenome is a genome database purely based on the Semantic Web technology which enables integration of heterogeneous data and adaptable semantic searches. All the information is stored as Resource Description Framework (RDF) data and reporting web pages are generated on-the-fly using SPARQL queries. TogoGenome provides a semantic faceted search system by gene functional annotations, taxonomy, phenotypes, and environments based on the relevant ontologies. It also serve as a platform to conduct semantic comparative genomics where a user can find pan-organism or organism specific genes based on the functional aspect of gene annotations and the combination of organisms from different taxa. The TogoGenome database has a modularized structure and each module in the report pages is separately served as TogoStanza, which is a generic framework for rendering an information block as IFRAME/WebComponents, which can also be reused in constructing another database.

# NBDC RDF portal

A great variety of lifescience databases exist, but their diverse terminologies and data formats have hindered the integrative utilizations of them. To address the problem, The National Bioscience Database Center (Department of NBDC Program, currently) of JST and DBCLS have been encouraging the research groups developing lifescience databases in Japan to adopt the RDF which is recognized as a promising technology to enhance the interoperability between databases and automated data processing. To improve the findability of those RDF, NBDC launched a new portal site, named NBDC RDF portal, which focuses on RDFized lifescience databases developed in Japan.<br/>

#### Checking reliability of an SPARQL endpoint of interest

* You can check a history of up/down ratios or presence of standard metadata such as VoID or SD.

#### Facilitating knowledge sharing on each SPARQL endpoint

* Umaka-Yummy Data enables knowledge sharing and discussion concerning each SPARQL endpoint by using the github issues service.

#### Endpoint search

* You can search for a SPARQL endpoint by its name or metadata

### Usage

* Checking reliability of a SPARQL endpoint of interest

* Posting a question or suggestion and sharing knowledge

* Using several data provided by Umaka-Yummy Data to choose a SPARQL endpoint for a federated query

### Next step

Adding more SPARQL endpoints, increasing stability or robustness of the application to monitor endpoints, and revising the calculation method to score each endpoint.

# TogoDX/Human
## What is TogoDX?
TogoDX (Togo Data eXplorer) is a framework for integrated exploration of various databases in the life sciences, integrated using a knowledge graph. TogoDX aims to provide a new mechanism for flexibly extracting useful data for data science by narrowing down the search by attribute.

## About TogoDX/Human
TogoDX/Human provides a one-stop interface for exploring information on genes, proteins, compounds, diseases, etc. related to humans collected and integrated from domestic and foreign databases using the TogoDX framework. Currently, more than 50 attributes from about 20 databases are available.

## Features of TogoDX/Human
- Depending on the user's purpose or interest, by selecting a part of the hierarchical classification or continuous value distribution for each attribute, results that satisfy those conditions (e.g., a list of applicable proteins) can be obtained, which can be applied to narrowing down the research target.
- By entering the user's ID list (e.g., a list of genes obtained from the experiment), the distribution in each attribute can be grasped from a bird's eye view, and unexpected connections and biases in other attributes can help in the interpretation and discussion of the results of the experiment.
- For results that have been narrowed down, information related to that ID can be easily viewed, and attribute information can be downloaded for further integrated analysis.

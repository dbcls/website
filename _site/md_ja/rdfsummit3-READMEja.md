# RDF summit for genome variations

RDF summit is organized by the Database Center for Life Science ([DBCLS](http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/)).

## The 3rd RDF summit in 2018

Main theme of the 3rd RDF summit is to standardize the RDF representation of genomic variations. As we have succeeded to standardize the annotation of sequence locations with the [FALDO](http://biohackathon.org/resource/faldo) ontology during the 1st RDF summit, we would like to use this opportunity to synchronize how to make semantic annotations on genome variations by the international collaboration -- hopefully aligned with the Ensembl/Broad/UCSC/GA4GH etc. projects.

In Japan, the [MED2RDF](http://med2rdf.org/) project is working on RDFization of biomedical databases, [DBCLS](http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/)/[NBDC](https://biosciencedbc.jp/en/) is developing a new TogoVar database which accumulates Japanese genome variations, and [AMED](https://www.amed.go.jp/en/) project is going to provide annotated disease related variants found by the Japanese medical community in the new MGeND database. All those projects have a need to develop a standard representation of variations in RDF.

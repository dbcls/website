# TogoVar

TogoVar (NBDC's integrated database of Japanese genomic variation) is a database that has collected and organized genome sequence differences between individuals (variants) in the Japanese population and disease information associated with them.

TogoVar provides variant frequencies in the Japanese population that have been aggregated across research projects. Two available datasets, JGA-NGS and JGA-SNP, are obtained by aggregating individual genomic data that have been registered in the NBDC Human Database / Japanese Genotype-phenotype Archive (JGA). In addition, TogoVar integrates information related to genotypes or phenotypes that has been compiled independently in a variety of different databases and provides information for interpreting variants in a one-stop, easy-to-understand manner.

TogoVar has been developed as a joint research project of National Bioscience Database Center (NBDC), Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST) and Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS), Joint Support-Center for Data Science Research, Research Organization of Information and Systems (ROIS) .

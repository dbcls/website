### Features of SPARQL Builder

#### SPARQL query generation mainly by mouse operations.

* A user can generate SPARQL queries for SPARQL endpoints having life science datasets mainly by mouse operations using information obtained from visualized class-class relationships.

#### Visualization of paths of class-class relationships computed by the system.

* The system computes paths o class-class relationships with properties automatically using information obtained by SPARQL endpoints.

#### Direct connection to SPARQL endpoints using a generated query.

* A SPARQL query generated by users can be sent directly to SPARQL endpoints by using the Send SPARQL button.

#### A Web API for developers of applications.

* A Web API is available to use functions of SPARQL Builder for application softwares developed by users.

### Usage

* Select classes start class and end class from the two lists. 
* After a list of paths between start class and end class is shown, select one path and click it.
* A SPARQL query is constructed and shown in the text area.

### What is TogoTable

TogoTable is a web tool to add user-specified annotations from several biological databases to a user-uploaded table that contains identifiers of a biological database. First, upload a tab separated value (TSV) file, and select annotations that you want in the next page. TSV file can be exported by spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel. Detailed operations are described in the Help page. You can also define your own configuration to retrieve any annotations provided by any SPARQL endpoint. See the Help for configuration page.

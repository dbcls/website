# RDF summit for individual genomics

RDF summit organized by the Database Center for Life Science ([DBCLS](http://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/)).

## The 2nd RDF summit in 2016

Main theme of the 2nd RDF summit is development and utilization of the reference genome graph which is proposed by the [GA4GH](https://genomicsandhealth.org) for representing variations in individual genomes. In [the 1st RDF summit](https://github.com/dbcls/rdfsummit), we worked on the standardization of the RDF representation of genome/sequence annotations in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank and Ensembl. It would be ideal to efficiently integrate those two graphs for the future applications in life sciences.

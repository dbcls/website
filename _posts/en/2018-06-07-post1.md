“TogoVar” is an integrated database for human genome variants/variations in Japanese population. With “TogoVar”, you can search allele frequencies of human genome variants/variations among several databases including new data sets generated from the genome data of Japanese people registered in the NBDC Human Database. “TogoVar” aims to be a Japanese genome information infrastructure and contribute to the development of genomic medical science, which would lead to advancement of personalized medicine (high-precision medicine) including genetic counseling.

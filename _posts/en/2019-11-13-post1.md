A paper “Evaluation of off‐target effects of gapmer antisense oligonucleotides using human cells” was published in Genes to Cells. Dr. Yuki Naito of DBCLS has contributed to this work in exhaustive off-target searches using GGGenome ([https://GGGenome.dbcls.jp/](https://GGGenome.dbcls.jp/)), fast and accurate sequence search software developed by DBCLS.

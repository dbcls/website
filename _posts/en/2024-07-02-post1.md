A research group with the participation of Prof. Hidemasa Bono of Hiroshima University, who is a visiting professor of DBCLS, and former member, Dr. Takeru Nakazato (now at the National Institute of Technology and Evaluation) has published a paper entitled "High expression of serine protease, Brachyurin in the posterior midgut of black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) during horse dropping processing." in the journal BMC Research Notes. The paper can be found at the following URL

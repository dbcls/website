In order to further enhance the provision of information on intractable diseases, DBCLS has updated "NANDO," a lexicon of names of intractable diseases, and renewed "NanbyoData," a portal site for information on intractable diseases.<br/>

NANDO has newly registered 91 additional diseases, bringing the total vocabulary to 341 designated intractable diseases and 845 pediatric chronic diseases.<br />

The following new information has been added to NanbyoData, mainly to the disease information pages, and the user interface (UI) has been improved to be more intuitive and easier to browse.
- Detailed information with external links (including a feedback feature)
- Number of Specified Medical Expense Beneficiary Certificate Holders (in Japan)
- Sub-classes disease information

We will continue to promote the construction of an information infrastructure to contribute to research and information sharing on intractable diseases.<br />

[TogoDX/human](https://togodx.dbcls.jp/human/) is a new application for the integrated exploration of life science data on humans.
 
 <br/>
We are pleased to announce that the addition of 14 new attributes and that "Ensembl transcript" can now be selected as the target dataset for the exploration. In addition, we have just updated the data for the 10 original sources used to create the existing attributes.
 <br/>
For details, please see below.

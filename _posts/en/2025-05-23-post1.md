Thank you for using DBCLS services.<br />

We would like to announce the termination of the “SPARQL Builder” service, which provided an intuitive GUI for assisting users in writing SPARQL queries for life science databases.<br />

As the original developer of the system has already left, and there are no plans for future updates or redevelopment, we have decided to discontinue the service entirely.<br />

Please note that the SPARQLBuilder Ontology remains available at the following URL:
[http://www.sparqlbuilder.org/2015/09/rdf-metadata-schema](http://www.sparqlbuilder.org/2015/09/rdf-metadata-schema)<br />

Sorry for the inconvenience it may cause.<br />

Scheduled date of service suspension: May 31<br />

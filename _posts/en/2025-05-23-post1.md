Thank you for using DBCLS services.<br />

We would like to announce the termination of the “SPARQL Builder” service, which provided an intuitive GUI for assisting users in writing SPARQL queries for life science databases.<br />

As the original developer of the system has already left, and there are no plans for future updates or redevelopment, we have decided to discontinue the service entirely.<br />

The SPARQL Builder Ontology remains available at the following URL:<br />
[http://www.sparqlbuilder.org/2015/09/rdf-metadata-schema](http://www.sparqlbuilder.org/2015/09/rdf-metadata-schema)

In addition, the source code for the service is available at the following GitHub repository:<br />
[https://github.com/sparqlbuilder/sparqlbuilder](https://github.com/sparqlbuilder/sparqlbuilder)

Sorry for the inconvenience it may cause.<br />

Scheduled date of service suspension: May 31<br />

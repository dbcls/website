NBDC Human Database  will be available from Apr 2024 at the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS) in cooperation with DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ), on behalf of NBDC.<br/>

Prior to the formal website launch, the DBCLS will begin review of applications on February 1.<br/>
The guidelines necessary for the start of the review process were discussed at [the Data Sharing Subcommittee](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/PDF/20240201DataSharingSubcommittee_en.pdf) of the DBCLS, and the following guidelines have been finalized.<br/>
-[NBDC Human Data Sharing Guidelines](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/PDF/20240201humandata_sharing_guidelines_en.pdf)<br/>
-NBDC Human Data Security Guidelines [for Data Submitters](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/PDF/20240201humandata_security_guidelines_submitters_en.pdf), [for Data Users](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/PDF/20240201humandata_security_guidelines_users_en.pdf) and [for Database Center Operation Managers](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/PDF/20240201humandata_security_guidelines_database_managers_en.pdf)<br/>
The revisions were made mainly due to the change in the operating entity. The basic rules remain unchanged, and the members of [the Human Data Review Board](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/PDF/20240201HumanDataReviewBoard_en.pdf), which is in charge of reviewing the applications, are also unchanged. <br/>

Please note that NBDC will continue to provide non-review service. such as receiving applications and inquiry-responses, until the end of March. <br/>
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact at <br/>
Secretariats of Data Sharing Subcommittee and Human Data Review Board (DBCLS)<br/>

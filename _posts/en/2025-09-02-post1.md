To enhance the provision of information on intractable diseases, DBCLS has updated NANDO, a vocabulary of names of intractable diseases. In addition, through international collaboration with the University of Bonn, Germany, facial feature data have been integrated into NanbyoData, a portal site for information on intractable diseases.<br />

NANDO has registered 55 additional diseases, including 7 newly designated intractable diseases in April 2025 in Japan, resulting in a vocabulary for 348 designated intractable diseases and 858 specific chronic pediatric diseases.<br />

NanbyoData integrates 2,447 facial feature data related to 207 diseases based on international collaboration with GestaltMatcher (GM), which is being developed at the University of Bonn, Germany. This has enabled a more intuitive understanding of the characteristics of each disease, further expanding the information base that contributes to the understanding of intractable diseases and diagnostic support in clinical practice and research.<br />

DBCLS will continue to promote international joint research and build an information infrastructure that contributes to research and information sharing on intractable diseases.<br />

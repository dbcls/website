A research group led by DBCLS Visiting Professor Hidemasa Bono, Visiting Associate Professor Yuki Naito, and former member Hiromasa Ono (now at PtBio Inc.) has published a paper entitled â€œRisk Prediction of RNA Off-Targets of CRISPR Base Editors in Tissue-Specific Transcriptomes Using Language Models. The paper was published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences (IJMS), Special issue: [Research Advances in the Bioinformatics of Genome Editing and Gene Function Analysis](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms/special_issues/3559O8TM24).

Base editing technology (particularly cytosine base editor: CBE)  can modify genes without DNA double-strand breaks, however, unintended RNA editing (RNA off-target effects) may occur, and the actual situation has not been fully clarified.<br/>
In this study, newly developed CBE-induced RNA off-target effect analysis pipeline, PiCTURE has revealed that unexpected edits occur in addition to previously known patterns of RNA editing.<br/>
In addition, based on the DNABERT-2, one of the DNA language models, machine learning models STL and SNL, also called RNAOffScan, were developed to predict RNA off-target risk with a high accuracy. The PROTECTiO pipeline was newly established to demonstrate the practical application of the predictive model for CBE-induced RNA off-target risk. The pipeline estimated risk in specific tissues, for example, low risk in the brain and ovaries, but high risk in the colon and lungs.<br/>
This study offers a standard method for assessing RNA off-target risks, marking a significant step toward improving the safety of CBE and is expected to contribute to base-editing specificity and therapeutic applicability.

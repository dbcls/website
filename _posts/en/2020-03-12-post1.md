A paper “GLIS1, a novel hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, promotes breast cancer cell motility via activation of WNT5A” was published in Carcinogenesis.
Dr. Hidemasa Bono and Dr. Hiromasa Ono from DBCLS have contributed to this work in data analysis using public gene expression database. It is mainly based on the use of a web tool [RefEx](https://refex.dbcls.jp/) that allows easy search and browsing of gene expression levels in normal tissues and cells for each gene.

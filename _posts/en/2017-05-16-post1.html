OVERVIEW
<br />
——–
<br />
BioHackathon 2017 (BH17) will be held in Tokyo and Morioka, Iwate, Japan
from Sep 9th to 16th, 2017.
<br />
NBDC and DBCLS have been organizing annual BioHackathons since 2008,
mainly focusing on standardization and interoperability of bioinformatics
data and web servicess for improving integration, preservation and
utilization of databases in life sciences.
<br />
This year, we will host the hackathon in Morioka with a generous support
from the Iwate Medical University where our collaborators are conducting
a cohort project for Japanese populations.
<br />
<br />
OBJECTIVES
<br />
———-
<br />
From the experiences obtained through a series of BioHackathons, we have
chosen the Semantic Web as a key technology for improving integration and
utilization of data. As a result of ourcommunity efforts, A number of major
databases have been publicly available as RDF resources, e.g,
<br />
<br />
　* DNA sequences and annotations: INSDC (DDBJ), Ensembl<br />
　* Protein sequences and annotations: UniProt<br />
　* Protein 3D structures: PDB<br />
　* Chemical substances: PubChem, ChEMBL<br />
　* Pathways and interactions: Reactome, PSICQUIC<br />
　* Biomedical databases: ClinVar, ExAC, MedGen<br />
　* Text resources: MeSH, PubAnnotations<br />
　* and more …<br />
<br />
and, now it is demanded to create applications based on them, while we also
continue developing tools, ontologies and RDF data as we have done in the
previous BioHackathons.

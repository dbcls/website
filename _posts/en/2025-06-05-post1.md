TogoVar, the integrated database for human genome variants ([https://togovar.org/](https://togovar.org/)), continues to implement new features and expand its data. We are pleased to announce the following new features:

- Mappings between mouse variants in MoG+ ([Mouse genome database with high added value](https://molossinus.brc.riken.jp/mogplus/)) and human variants in TogoVar, are now available on gene pages (e.g., [BRCA2 gene](https://grch38.togovar.org/gene/1101#mouse-variants-in-mogplus-database)). These mappings are based on [the UCSC Chain File](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/liftOver/). You can now search for laboratory mouse strains that carry variants corresponding to human missense or pathogenic variants. MoG+ is developed and maintained by [RIKEN BioResource Research Center](https://web.brc.riken.jp/en/).
- Protein Browser has been added to the gene pages (e.g., [BRCA2 gene](https://grch38.togovar.org/gene/1101#protein-browser)). The following data are aligned along an amino acid sequence to facilitate comparison:
  - Missense variants and their pathogenicity (Source: TogoVar)
  - Phosphorylation sites (Source: [jPOST: Japan ProteOme STandard Repository/Database](https://jpostdb.org/))
  - Glycosylation sites (Source: GlyCosmos: [Glycoscience Portal](https://glycosmos.org/))
  - Disease-related variants (Source: [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/))
- The URL specification method was extended on the variant pages. For example, the page for tgv47264307 can now be displayed using the following URLs:
  - By chromosome number, base position, reference allele, and alternate allele: 
    - [https://grch38.togovar.org/variant/12-111803962-G-A](https://grch38.togovar.org/variant/12-111803962-G-A)
  - By dbSNP rs number: 
    - [https://grch38.togovar.org/variant/rs671](https://grch38.togovar.org/variant/rs671)

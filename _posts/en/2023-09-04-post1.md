DBCLS released a new service, TogoMedium. TogoMedium is a comprehensive knowledge base focused on culture media for microorganisms. The media available in TogoMedium have been compiled from information provided by diverse bioresource centers and research papers. All information in TogoMedium is described as RDF and the composition of these media is described with Growth Medium Ontology. This enables users to investigate the interconnectedness between organisms, media, and their ingredients, facilitating a deeper understanding of their relationships.

A paper "Clinical usefulness of multigene screening with phenotype-driven bioinformatics analysis for the diagnosis of patients with monogenic diabetes or severe insulin resistance" was published in Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice. Dr. Toyofumi Fujiwara of DBCLS has contributed to this work for prioritizing candidate variants in targeted resequencing data using PubCaseFinder ([https://pubcasefinder.dbcls.jp/](https://pubcasefinder.dbcls.jp/)), rare and genetic disease search system developed by DBCLS.

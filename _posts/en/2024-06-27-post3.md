title: 'Termination of "AOE" Service'
---
Thank you for using DBCLS services.<br />

We would like to announce the termination of the service of "AOE (All Of gene Expression)" which is an index of public gene expression database. Due to the departure of the developer of the service, we had kept the data updated automatically to some extent, but the system also becomes to be updated. Since we do not plan to redevelop the tool in the future, we have decided to terminate the service itself.<br />
Please use [NCBI GEO](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), etc. as an alternative service.<br />

Soryy for the inconvenience it may cause.<br />

Scheduled date of service suspension: July 16

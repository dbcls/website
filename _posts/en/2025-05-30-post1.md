A research group led by DBCLS Project Assistant Professor Hirokazu Chiba, Visiting Professor Hidemasa Bono, and former member Dr. Hiromasa Ono, has published comprehensive gene expression data from the silk glands of silkworms.

Silkworms are not only used for silk production, but also for the synthesis of valuable proteins. The release of this dataset serves as an important basis for improving silk productivity and accelerating the breeding of silkworm strains, and is expected to contribute to the revitalization of sericulture industry and the development of new bio-industries.

The gene expression data is located at  [https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6978654](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6978654)

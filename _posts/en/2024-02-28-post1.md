“TogoVar” ([https://togovar.org/](https://togovar.org/)), a comprehensive Japanese genetic variation database, is continuously adding new functions and expanding data. We are pleased to announce the release of the following new features.

- Addition of annotation: We have added the results of AlphaMissense ([Cheng et al. 2023](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adg7492)), an algorithm predicting the pathogenicity of missense variants that alter the amino acid sequence of proteins. AlphaMissense utilizes AlphaFold2 ([Jumper et al. 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03819-2)), a method for predicting the three-dimensional structure of proteins, to achieve higher prediction accuracy than conventional methods.

- Update of dataset: [The Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD)](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/) has been updated to version 4.0. This update significantly increased the number of individuals whose whole exomes have been analyzed. For more details, please see "[What's in gnomAD](https://gnomad.broadinstitute.org/stat)".

You can check the [History](https://grch38.togovar.org/doc/history) page of the TogoVar website for information on previous feature additions.

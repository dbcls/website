A paper "ChIP-Atlas: a data-mining suite powered by full integration of public ChIP-seq data" was published in EMBO Reports. DBCLS's project researcher Tazro Ohta has been contributing to this project.
<br />
<br />
ChIP-Atlas [https://chip-atlas.org](https://chip-atlas.org) is a database to provide ChIP-Seq/DNase-Seq data retrieved from Sequence Read Archive. The research group retrieved data from the archive and re-analyzed, then developed a web application system that users can view data on genome browser, find target genes and colocalized partners of transcription factors. Users also can submit their lists of genes or regions of genome to perform enrichment analysis using transcription factor binding sites. The paper also showed that the group found the transcription factors regulating tissue specific gene expression activities by using ChIP-Atlas. The system will be one of the valuable resources of transcription regulation data available to all the researchers.

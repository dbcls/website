## The 6th Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH6)
[http://blah6.linkedannotation.org](http://blah6.linkedannotation.org)

### OVERVIEW
The 6th Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon (BLAH6) will be held from 4th through 7th February 2020, in Tokyo, Japan.
BLAH6 is organized as an open forum for collaborative development of software, data sets, specifications, application cases, and so on, with the goal of creating “linked”  or "interoperable" annotation resources for biomedical literature. It is organized as a one-day symposium and a three-day hackathon. The symposium day consists of a series of keynote addresses and talks by participants. The hackathon focuses on projects proposed by the participants themselves.

### Date
* Symposium: Feb 4th (Tue), 2020
* Hackathon: Feb 5th (Wed) - 7th (Fri), 2020

### Venue
[Japan Science Technology Agency Tokyo Headquarters (Science Plaza)](https://www.jst.go.jp/EN/about/access.html#Tokyo)  
5-3, Yonbancho, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 102-8666 Japan


### Call for proposals
We invite proposals for symposium talks and associated projects. Consistent with BLAH's role as an open forum for work on linking resources for biomedical text mining, we solicit proposals for projects on resources, linking, biomedical text mining, and applications of those three in combination.
 
In this year, we set "social media mining" as the special theme of BLAH6, and encourage potential participants to consider their contribution to that direction.
 
* Submission due: Nov 29th (Fri), 2019
* Notification : Dec 9th (Mon), 2019

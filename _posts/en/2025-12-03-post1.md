title: '[Press Release] Comprehensive Database "JoGo" for Human Gene "Types" Now Publicly Available ~Contains 4.7 Million Sequence Types for 19,000 Genes, Supporting Disease and Genetic Analysis~'
---
A research group including Project Professor Toshiaki Katayama, Associate Project Professor Yuki Moriya, Associate Project Professor Shuichi Kawashima, and Project Researcher Nobutaka Mitsuhashi from DBCLS has established a universal new genotype notation system (”ACTG hierarchical nomenclature”). They have organized 4,656,478 genotypes for 19,194 human genes into a database, JoGo (Joint Open Genome and Omics: [https://jogo.csml.org](https://jogo.csml.org)). This dictionary for expressing genes in genomic medical science enables handling "line" information—the sequence type of entire genes—whereas previous genetic analysis focused on "point" information about individual variants. By developing this dictionary, we can understand disease associations and drug responses at higher resolution.<br />

<br />
The NBDC/DBCLS BioHackathon series have been contributing for integration and utilization of life sciences and biomedical databases ([read more about the past hackathons ...](http://www.biohackathon.org/)). In this year, in addition to our continuous efforts on promoting the development for standardization and interoperability of life sciences / biomedical databases and their applications in data science, we are particularly interested in developing application cases of those tools to following subject areas:  
* Medical application
* Useful substance production
* Breeding

Also, this BioHackathon is in collaboration with the [ELIXIR BioHackathon](http://bh2018paris.info) for the first time.

Results of an international joint research in which a DBCLS's Project Professor Toshiaki Katayama participated has been published.

The full-length genome sequences of 10 Japanese and 9 Saudi Arabian individuals has been determined by long read sequencers and registered in a public database. Using this information, Pangenome graphs, which show genome sequence differences between individuals, reveal complex genome structures and a foundation for community-specific precision medicine and genetic diagnosis can be provided.<br />

Please find the details at the publication titled as "Phased genome assemblies and pangenome graphs of human populations of Japan and Saudi Arabia"<br />

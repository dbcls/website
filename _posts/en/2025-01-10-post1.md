A paper on the update of [TogoID](https://togoid.dbcls.jp/), the DBCLS's ID conversion service, "Expanding the concept of ID conversion in TogoID by introducing multi-semantic and label features" has been published in the Journal of Biomedical Semantics. The paper can be found at the following URL
[https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-024-00322-1](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-024-00322-1)


TogoID is an ID conversion service that allows users to obtain ID relationships between diverse categories of life science databases. We have now expanded its ability to express semantics between datasets to handle multiple semantic relationships within dataset pairs. This allows, for example, different types of relationships between glycans and proteins (e.g., "binding" or "process") to be distinguished. Other new features include the ability to display labels corresponding to IDs, to convert labels to IDs, and to share complex search results as URLs. With these additional functions, TogoID expands the concept of ID conversion and supports more comprehensive and efficient data integration across life science databases.<br />

The NanbyoData database ([https://nanbyodata.jp/](https://nanbyodata.jp/?lang=en)), which focuses on rare diseases in the Japanese population, collects and provides the latest and most comprehensive information on rare diseases from around the world for healthcare professionals.
<br />

Recently, NanbyoData has integrated glycan-related gene information. In collaboration with the glycoscience portal “[GlyCosmos](https://glycosmos.org/)”, 244 glycan-related genes have been linked to rare disease data, and 417 rare disease entries have been updated to include glycan-related information.
<br />

By elucidating the relationship between glycans and diseases, this integration is expected to contribute to further advancements in rare disease research. We encourage you to explore and utilize this new resource.

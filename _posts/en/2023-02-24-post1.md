In the biomedical sciences, especially in the field of genomics, data analysis is commonly performed using a set of processes, as known as workflows, combining various software. As complicated workflows are difficult to build, maintain, and run, researchers publish and share workflows to reduce the costs in data analysis and to increase the transparency of published data analysis. However, the maintenance of published workflows is left to the developers. The paper describes a method and its implementation for maintaining workflow quality through automated testing and sharing reusable workflows.

The software is available as an OSS on GitHub.

“TogoVar” ([https://togovar.org/](https://togovar.org/)), a comprehensive Japanese genetic variation database, is continuously adding new functions and expanding data. We are pleased to announce the release of the following new features.

- Addition of download file format: Allele frequency information for all variants is now available in VCF format in addition to the TSV format that was previously provided.
- Update of dataset: ToMMo 54KJPN (ToMMo 54KJPN-SNV/INDEL Allele Frequency Panel (v 20230626)) has been released. The number of variants has been greatly increased.
- Additional Functions to "Advanced search": Search by variant ID is now available, including TogoVar ID (e.g., tgv47264307) or dbSNP refSNP ID (e.g., rs671). Please select “Variant ID” from the “Add condition” pull-down menu.

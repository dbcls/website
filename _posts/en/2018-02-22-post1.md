title: 'A paper “Differentiated Embryo Chondrocyte plays a crucial role in DNA damage
  response via transcriptional regulation under hypoxic conditions” was
  published in PLOS ONE.'
---
A paper “Differentiated Embryo Chondrocyte plays a crucial role in DNA damage response via transcriptional regulation under hypoxic conditions” was published in PLOS One.
Dr. Hidemasa Bono in DBCLS deeply contributed to this work in collecting hypoxia related genes from public gene expression database.

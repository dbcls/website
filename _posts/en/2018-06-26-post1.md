A paper “Suppression of mitochondrial oxygen metabolism mediated by the transcription factor HIF-1 alleviates propofol-induced cell toxicity” was published in Scientific Reports.
Dr. Hidemasa Bono from DBCLS have contributed to this work in the transcriptome data analysis of renal Cell-derived RCC4 cells and the functional interpretation of analyzed data.

title: 'Data update for "TogoVar"'
---
“TogoVar”[https://togovar.org/](https://togovar.org/), a comprehensive Japanese genetic variation database, is continuously adding new functions and expanding data. We are pleased to announce the data update as follows<br />

- Allele frequencies and genotype counts (by disease and sex) of [45 diseases](https://grch38.togovar.org/doc/datasets/jga_snp#diseases_jgad000123) out of 47 diseases in the first cohort of [BioBank Japan](https://biobankjp.org/en/) of those genomic information determined by SNP arrays analyzed by [RIKEN](https://www.ims.riken.jp/english/) have been added to [JGA-SNP dataset](https://grch38.togovar.org/doc/datasets/jga_snp) as disease-specific information.
The genotyping data analyzed by RIKEN are registered in the NBDC human database as [JGAS000114 / JGAD000123](https://humandbs.dbcls.jp/en/hum0014-latest).

- Allele frequencies and genotype counts of 9,290 Japanese for whom [National Center Biobank Network (NCBN)](https://ncbiobank.org/en/) collected samples and performed whole genome analyses are available as [NCBN datasets](https://grch38.togovar.org/doc/datasets/ncbn) (GRCh38 only). The frequency data is registered as hum0331.v1.freq.v1 in the NBDC human database and can be downloaded from [the data page](https://humandbs.dbcls.jp/en/hum0331-v1).

The international edition of the global disease ontology "Mondo Disease Ontology (Mondo)" has been released. The Japanese translation was carried out by the Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS), and it is now available under the CC-BY 4.0 license on the official Mondo website, accessible to anyone.<br />

Mondo integrates information from international disease databases such as OMIM, Orphanet, and NCIt, providing standardized disease information as an international ontology widely used in the diagnosis and research of rare and genetic diseases. With the release of the international edition, Japanese researchers and medical professionals can now access disease information in Japanese, further promoting diagnostic support and research activities within Japan.<br />

DBCLS will continue to maintain the Japanese translation in accordance with Mondo updates, ensuring timely inclusion of newly added diseases.<br />

The Mondo international edition is introduced on the [download page](https://mondo.monarchinitiative.org/pages/download/) of the official Mondo website. Additionally, specific Japanese translations can also be referenced through the [EMBL-EBI Ontology Lookup Service](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/mondo?lang=jp), so please check it as well. <br />

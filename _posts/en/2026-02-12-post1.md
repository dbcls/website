Results of a joint research in which a DBCLS's Project Associate Professor Shuichi Kawashima and Deputy Director Susumu Goto participated has been published in "Scientific Data" on February 11, 2026.<br />

The research outcomes include:
1. Developing "AutoFixMark," software that accurately predicts the carbon dioxide (CO₂) fixation pathways possessed by chemolithoautotrophic bacteria based on genomic information.
2. Defining characteristic marker genes for all seven known CO₂ fixation pathways
3. Constructing a high-quality reference dataset containing genomic information and CO₂ fixation pathway information for 347 chemolithoautotrophic bacterial strains<br /><br />

Please find the details at the publication titled as "A curated resource of chemolithoautotrophic genomes and marker genes for CO2 fixation pathway prediction"<br />

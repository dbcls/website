**BioHackathon 2019**: [http://2019.biohackathon.org/](http://2019.biohackathon.org/)

**OVERVIEW**

The 12th [NBDC](https://biosciencedbc.jp/en/)/[DBCLS](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/index-en.html) BioHackathon will be held from 1st through 7th September 2019, in Fukuoka, Japan.
<br />
The NBDC/DBCLS BioHackathon series have been contributing for integration and utilization of life sciences and biomedical databases ([read more about the past hackathons ...](http://www.biohackathon.org/)). Thanks to the international community efforts in these years, structured semantic data has been accumulated that are ready to be analyzed. We expect that integrated use of data from multiple domains will enable new discoveries by the development of methods and applications in data science.

Note that, this BioHackathon is in collaboration with [the 2nd ELIXIR BioHackathon](https://www.biohackathon-europe.org/).

Illustration contents of TogoTV have been newly added to the "Education" section of [JSHG\-WebCast（JWC）](https://jshg.jp/webcast/), which is available on the website of the Japan Society of Human Genetics (JSHG). The JSHG-WebCast team made significant contributions by surveying needs in the field, selecting illustration themes, and conducting expert reviews, while the TogoTV team produced the illustrations.

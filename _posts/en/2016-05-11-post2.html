<p>A paper “Weighted Enrichment Method for Prediction of Transcription Regulators from Transcriptome and Global Chromatin Immunoprecipitation data” has published in Nucleic Acids Research. Tazro Ohta from DBCLS has contributed to this work in the public data analysis and the development and the operation of the web application <a href="http://wpgsa.org/">wpgsa.org</a> which provides online execution of the method.</p>

<p>The open-access full paper can be found online at:

<p>Eiryo Kawakami, Shinji Nakaoka, Tazro Ohta, and Hiroaki Kitano, “Weighted Enrichment Method for Prediction of Transcription Regulators from Transcriptome and Global Chromatin Immunoprecipitation data”, Nucleic Acids Research, doi: 10.1093/nar/gkw355</p>

<p>The authors have performed the meta-analysis of more than 3,500 ChIP experiments archived in the public data repository to develop the gene regulation network based on the existing result of the experiment. The authors also introduced a method called weighted Parametric Gene Set Analysis: wPGSA to the gene regulation network to predict the activation of gene transcription factor.</p>

			<p class="about__description">Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS) was established in April 2007 at Research
				Organization of Information and Systems (ROIS). We have been developing new technologies, services and standards
				for integrating biological databases, which include those developed and maintained in Japan as well as
				world-renowned databases.</p>
			<p class="about__description">We collaborate with Bioinformation and DDBJ Center
				(DDBJ), also belonging to ROIS, for the nucleotide sequence and gene expression data integration and for the
				development of technologies for their meta-analysis and tools for sequence and function annotation. We also
				conduct a collaborative research and development with Department of NBDC Program (NBDC) at Japan Science and
				Technology Agency (JST), and mainly working on the basic technology development regarding database integration
				and preservation. </p>
			<p class="about__description">
				Since 2016 when the Joint-Support Center for Data Science (DS) was established at ROIS, DBCLS has been one of
				the five centers in DS and we are now involving open data and open science initiative with the other centers
				that deals with data from various fields including polar and social sciences.
